These are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority:

这些是布尔运算，按升序排序：

Operation | Result                             | Notes
----      | ----                               | ----
x or y    | if x is false, then y, else x      | (1)
x and y   |  if x is false, then x, else y     | (2)
not x     |if x is false, then True, else False| (3)

Notes:


- This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is false.
- This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is true.
- not has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so not a == b is interpreted as not (a == b), and a == not b is a syntax error.
