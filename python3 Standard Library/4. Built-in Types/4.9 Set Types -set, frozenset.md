A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference. (For other containers see the built-in dict, list, and tuple classes, and the collections module.)

Like other collections, sets support x in set, len(set), and for x in set. Being an unordered collection, sets do not record element position or order of insertion. Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior.

There are currently two built-in set types, set and frozenset. The set type is mutable — the contents can be changed using methods like add() and remove(). Since it is mutable, it has no hash value and cannot be used as either a dictionary key or as an element of another set. The frozenset type is immutable and hashable — its contents cannot be altered after it is created; it can therefore be used as a dictionary key or as an element of another set.

Non-empty sets (not frozensets) can be created by placing a comma-separated list of elements within braces, for example: {'jack', 'sjoerd'}, in addition to the set constructor.

The constructors for both classes work the same:

class set([iterable])
class frozenset([iterable])

Return a new set or frozenset object whose elements are taken from iterable. The elements of a set must be hashable. To represent sets of sets, the inner sets must be frozenset objects. If iterable is not specified, a new empty set is returned.

Instances of set and frozenset provide the following operations:

len(s)

```python
>>> s = {1,2,3}
>>> len(s)
3
```

x in s
x not in s

```python
>>> 3 in s
True
>>> {3} in s
False
>>> 4 not in s
True
>>> {4} not in s
True
>>> 3 not in s
False
>>> {3} not in s
True
```

isdisjoint(other)

Return True if the set has no elements in common with other. Sets are disjoint if and only if their intersection is the empty set.

```python
>>> a = {1,2,3}
>>> b = {1,2,3,4}
>>> a.isdisjoint(b)
False
>>> b = {4,5}
>>> a.isdisjoint(b)
True
```

issubset(other)

set <= other
Test whether every element in the set is in other.

set < other
Test whether the set is a proper subset of other, that is, set <= other and set != other.

```python
>>> {1,2,3} <= {1,2,3,4}
True
>>> 1 <= {1,2}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#14>", line 1, in <module>
    1 <= {1,2}
TypeError: unorderable types: int() <= set()
>>> {1,2,3,4}.issubset({1,2,3})
False
>>> {1,2}.issubset({1,2,3,4})
True
```

issuperset(other)

set >= other
Test whether every element in other is in the set.

set > other
Test whether the set is a proper superset of other, that is, set >= other and set != other

```python
>>> {1,2,3,4} >= {1}
True
>>> {1,2,3,4}.issuperset({1})
True
```

union(*others)
set | other | ...

Return a new set with elements from the set and all others.

```python
>>> {1,2,3} | {1,2,3,4}
{1, 2, 3, 4}
>>> {1,2,3}.union({1,2,3,4})
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

intersection(*others)
set & other & ...

Return a new set with elements common to the set and all others.

```python
>>> {1,2,3} & {2}
{2}
>>> {1,2,3,4}.intersection({1})
{1}
```

difference(*others)
set - other - ...

Return a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.

```python
>>> {1,2,3,4} - {1}
{2, 3, 4}
>>> {1,2,3,4}.difference({1})
{2, 3, 4}
```

symmetric_difference(other)
set ^ other

Return a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.

```python
>>> {1,3} ^ {3,1}
set()
>>> {1,3} ^ {1,2}
{2, 3}
>>> {1,3}.symmetric_difference({1,2})
{2, 3}
```
copy()

Return a new set with a shallow copy of s.

```python
>>> {1,2}.copy()
{1, 2}
>>> [1,2].copy()
[1, 2]
```
The following table lists operations available for set that do not apply to immutable instances of frozenset:

下表中列出的操作可设置不适用于frozenset不变的情况下：

update(*others)
set |= other | ...

Update the set, adding elements from all others. 

```python
>>> {1,2} |= {4,5}
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
>>> a = {1,2}
>>> b = {3,4}
>>> a |= b
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 4}
>>> a = {1,2}
>>> a.update(b)
>>> a
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

intersection_update(*others)
set &= other & ...

Update the set, keeping only elements found in it and all others.

```python
>>> a = {1,2,3}
>>> b = {2,3,4}
>>> a &= b
>>> a
{2, 3}
>>> a = {1,2,3}
>>> b = {2,3,4}
>>> a.intersection_update(b)
>>> a
{2, 3}
```

difference_update(*others)
set -= other | ...

Update the set, removing elements found in others.

```python
>>> a = {1,2,3}
>>> b = {1}
>>> a -= b
>>> a
{2, 3}
>>> a = {1,2,3}
>>> a.difference_update(b)
>>> a
{2, 3}
```

symmetric_difference_update(other)
set ^= other

Update the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but not in both.

```python
>>> a = {1,3}
>>> b = {1,2}
>>> a ^= b
>>> a
{2, 3}
>>> a ={3,1}
>>> b = {1,2}
>>> a.symmetric_difference_update(b)
>>> a
{2, 3}
```

add(elem)
Add element elem to the set.

remove(elem)
Remove element elem from the set. Raises KeyError if elem is not contained in the set.

discard(elem)
Remove element elem from the set if it is present.

pop()
Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Raises KeyError if the set is empty.

clear()
Remove all elements from the set

```python
>>> a = {1}
>>> a.add(2)
>>> a
{1, 2}
>>> a.remove(1)
>>> a
{2}
>>> a.add({1})
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#78>", line 1, in <module>
    a.add({1})

    a.remove(1)

>>> a.discard(1)
>>> a

>>> a.add(1)

```

```bash
Note, the non-operator versions of the update(), intersection_update(), difference_update(), and symmetric_difference_update() methods will accept any iterable as an argument.
```

```bash
Note, the elem argument to the __contains__(), remove(), and discard() methods may be a set. To support searching for an equivalent frozenset, a temporary one is created from elem.
