There are eight comparison operations in Python. 

They all have the same priority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations). Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily; for example, x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).

python中有8种比较运算

它们有相同的优先级(比布尔运算更高)
x < y <= z 等价于  x < y and y <= z
当 x < y 是False 时 不在计算 y <= z

Operation | Meaning
----      | ---
<         | strictly less than
<=        | less than or equal
>         | strictly greater than
>=        |	greater than or equal
==        | equal
!=        | not equal
is        | object identity
is not    | negated object identity
