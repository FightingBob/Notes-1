4. Built-in Types

The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter.

The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.

Some collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but None.

Some operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the repr() function or the slightly different str() function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the print() function.

4.1 Truth Value Testing 

下面的值被认为是错误的:

- None
- False
- 0 的任意数字类型 如 0,0,0,0j
- 任意空的序列 如 '', (), []
- 任意空的映射 如 {}
- 当函数定义了__bool__() 或者 __len__(), 返回False 或者 整数0

All other values are considered true — so objects of many types are always true.

Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations or and and always return one of their operands.)

其他的值都被认为是真的-所以很多类型对象总是True

具有布尔结果的操作和内置函数总是返回0或false为false，1为true或true为true，除非另有说明。（重要的例外：布尔操作或总是返回一个操作数。）
